# Autowinder

This repository hosts simulation animations of the Autowinder algorithm for autonomous winding of HTS tape on nonplanar, mixed-concavity coils. The videos below show multi-cart coordination on trajectories with increasing numbers of concavities. As the number of concavities increases, the ratio of carts to concavities decreases. This produces longer dwell times at concave minima, visible as the stepped progression of carts in the animations. In the limit of many carts per concavity, the system approaches continuous locomotive motion; in the sparse case, it behaves like a relay with pronounced hand-offs (please give videos a moment to load).
